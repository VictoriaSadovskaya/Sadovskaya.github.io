&nbsp &nbsp   <b>Course description:</b> <i>This course is a part of the MASS Program. </i><br>
 &nbsp &nbsp  The theory of dynamical systems is a modern branch of mathematics. Its main objective is <br>
&nbsp &nbsp   to  analyze long-term behavior of systems that evolve over time. In this course, we will  <br> 
&nbsp &nbsp  introduce the fundamental concepts and tools of dynamics and discuss an array of examples  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp   with gradual increase in complexity. The topics will include contractions, linear maps,  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  differential equations, recurrence, equidistribution, hyperbolic systems, symbolic systems <br> 
&nbsp &nbsp  and coding, fractals, entropy, and chaos.
