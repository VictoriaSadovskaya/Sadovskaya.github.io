&nbsp &nbsp   <b>Course description:</b>&nbsp; 
The goal of the course is to introduce students to the main concepts 
<br> &nbsp &nbsp  
and tools of  general topology.  It covers metric spaces, topological spaces, separation axioms, 
<br> &nbsp &nbsp 
product spaces, identification spaces, compactness, connectedness, and fundamental group. 
<br> &nbsp &nbsp The course emphasizes development of mathematical theory with rigorous proofs. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  <i> Prerequisite:</i>&nbsp; Math 311W.
