&nbsp &nbsp   <b>Course description:</b>&nbsp; 
In this course we will introduce the fundamental concepts<br>
&nbsp &nbsp  and tools of dynamics, focusing on topological properties of dynamical systems. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  The topics will include periodic points, equidistribution, topological transitivity <br>
&nbsp &nbsp   and mixing, minimality, recurrence, equivalence of dynamical systems, topological <br>
&nbsp &nbsp    entropy, and structural stability. We will discuss a variety of examples including  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  circle maps, translations and flows on tori, symbolic dynamical systems, and <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  hyperbolic toral automorphisms.
 <br>
