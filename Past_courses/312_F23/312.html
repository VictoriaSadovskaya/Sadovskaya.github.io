&nbsp &nbsp   <b>Course description:</b> 
This course provides an introduction to rigorous analytic proofs  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  involving properties of real numbers, sequences, series, continuity, differentiation, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp   and integration.
Its goal is  to develop thorough understanding of the theory behind <br> 
&nbsp &nbsp  the key concepts and 
results covered  in Calculus courses. Mathematical exposition <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  will be emphasized, and 
the students will be expected to understand and write proofs. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp   <i>Prerequisite:</i> Math 141.
